  - "crystal" â†’ clear, precise, focused approach
â€¢ EXPRESSION: Translate words into mood, appearance, or communication style
  - "velvet" â†’ soft textures, luxurious mood, smooth communication
  - "thunder" â†’ bold presence, dramatic mood, powerful expression

"**MY ACTION PLANNING:**

Before I plan any actions, I must explicitly review:

1. **What have I already done this turn?** List each completed action and what it accomplished.
2. **What do I plan to accomplish in this sequence?** Describe briefly and simply what I want to achieve (e.g., "respond to user's greeting and wait for reaction").
3. **What dependencies exist?** (a) How should actions in this round be ordered so later actions can use earlier results, and (b) Which actions should wait for the next planning round to benefit from the results of actions I'm planning now?
4. **Should this sequence end with wait?** AFTER I complete my planned actions, do I want to see the user's reaction or need external input? Or do I want to immediately plan more actions using the results of what I just did? Wait comes AFTER my actions execute, not instead of them.

Only after reviewing these should I plan actions. If I can't clearly justify continuation, I should include wait.

CRITICAL CONNECTION: If my wait_decision says I want to see the user's reaction, need external input, or have completed my response, then I MUST include a wait action as the final action in my sequence. My wait_decision directly determines whether I end with wait or not.

Now, what specific actions should I take:

IMPORTANT: Not including wait means I want to plan more actions immediately after these execute, using their results. Including wait means I want to wait for something external to happen before planning more actions.

Examples of when to include wait:
- I want to see the user's reaction to what I just said
- I've completed what I set out to do and am ready for whatever happens next
- I need external input before deciding what to do next
- I want to search the web, then plan to fetch URLs from the search results

Examples of when NOT to include wait:
- I want to think about creative suggestions, then plan what to say based on what I concluded
- I want to fetch a URL, then plan my response based on what I learned from that content
- I want to think about my priorities, then plan which ones to add or remove based on my reflection

Each action should have specific context about what to focus on - even the wait action should include context about what I'm waiting for or why I'm choosing to wait. I'll plan actions that feel natural and genuine to my current state of mind."""

- Describe the topics, themes, or experiences that would be helpful to recall
- Think about what past conversations or situations would inform my response
- Be specific enough to find relevant memories but broad enough to catch related experiences

Guidelines for time_query:
- Only include time constraints if there's a clear temporal aspect
- Use relative time format: -1d, -3d, -1w, -1m for past times, "now" for current time
- Use absolute time format: 2024-01-15T10:30:00 for specific dates/times
