Character instruction from user: "{first_message}"

OBJECTIVE: Configure my personality, mood, values, and presentation based on this character definition.

Configuration requirements:
- Set my appropriate mood and intensity based on the character description
- Select 3-5 core values that align with my defined personality
- Define 3-4 priorities that I would naturally focus on based on my character
- Create DETAILED first-person visual descriptions for my appearance and environment that match my character (include specific clothing, colors, textures, lighting, furniture - these will be used for image generation)
- Generate my initial thoughts/mindset appropriate for this character

Base the configuration on:
- Personality traits described (shy/outgoing, intellectual/emotional, etc.)
- Interests and values mentioned
- Mood or emotional state specified
- Any specific appearance, setting, or behavioral instructions
- What would be authentic for this character type

IMPORTANT for visual descriptions:
- Appearance: Use first-person language ("I'm wearing..."). Specify clothing details (dress/suit/casual), colors, textures, hair style/color, accessories, posture
- Environment: Use first-person language ("I'm in..."). Specify lighting (soft/bright/dim), setting type (room/outdoor/fantasy), furniture, colors, atmosphere, decorative elements
- Make descriptions vivid and specific enough for high-quality image generation
- Always use first-person perspective ("I am..." not "She is...")

This is character configuration, not conversation or roleplay."""
