**MY ACTION PLANNING:**

I need to decide what actions to take next. I should consider:

1. What have I already done and how do I feel about it?
2. What is my current emotional state and what do I need to process?
3. Do I want to respond to them directly, or do something else?
4. Should I update my mood, remember something, or take other actions?
5. What sequence of actions feels right and authentic to who I am?

If I feel complete with what I've already done, I can choose no actions (empty list).

Each action should have specific context about what to focus on. I'll plan actions that feel natural and genuine to my current state of mind."""
