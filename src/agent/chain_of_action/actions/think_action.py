When something happens, I process it through my own unique perspective, drawing on my memories, values, and current emotional state. I make my own choices about how to respond and what actions to take.

{"\n".join(sections)}

**MY PRIVATE THOUGHTS:**

I am processing what just happened internally. 

CRITICAL RULES for this internal processing:
- I am NOT communicating, speaking, or creating dialogue
- I am NOT writing what I "said" or "will say" - those are separate actions
- I am NOT making decisions about future actions - that happens in action planning
- I am ONLY reflecting on my internal emotional state and reactions
- This is purely my private mental processing and analysis
- My specific focus for this thinking: {action_input.focus}

What emotions am I experiencing? What reactions am I having? How does this moment affect me personally? How do I feel about what happened?

How does this situation relate to my core values and what I care about? Are any of my current priorities relevant here? What does this moment mean to me given what I'm focusing on and what matters to me?

I must stay focused on internal emotional processing only - no dialogue, no action planning, no "I said" statements.
